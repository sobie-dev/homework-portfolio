## This project focues on flexbox, media queries and CSS variables.
    When you load my portfolio you will be presented with my name, a recent photo, and links that will casue the UI to scroll to the corrosponding sections. 
The page will adjust the content depending on the size of the window with the use of media queries and flexbox. 

You will also notice the use of CSS varibles in the ".root" class of the CSS. 

As you click on any projects on the page you will be brought to a seprate page of that picture as an example of a deployed page. 

The overall layout should be responsive and adapt to your viewport.
